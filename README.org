#+title: tree-jumper - jump to tree-sitter nodes with hints

* Demo
[[./demo.apng]]

* Colors
For each hint a random number is generated. Each value is produced by the
following formula:

~bg_color_value + tree-jumper-*-base + (random_value * tree-jumper-*-rand-coef)~

The value for hue is wrapped, saturation and luminance are clamped

* Example config
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package tree-jumper
    :straight (:host github :repo "kalin-p/tree-jumper" :branch main)
    :config
    ;; tweak how the colors are generated
    (setq tree-jumper-hue-rand-coef 0.15
          tree-jumper-saturation-rand-coef 0.0
          tree-jumper-luminance-rand-coef 0.0
          tree-jumper-hue-base 0.0
          tree-jumper-saturation-base 0.1
          tree-jumper-luminance-base 0.03)
    ;; set with which modes you want to use it 
    :hook ((rust-ts-mode python-ts-mode) . tree-jumper))
